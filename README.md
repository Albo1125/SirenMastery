# Siren Mastery
Siren Mastery is a plugin for RAGEPluginHook by Albo1125 with over 100k downloads on lspdfr.com. Originally released in 2016, this plugin provided a significant breakthrough for indepth siren customisation in the absence of a full ELS script at the time.

## Code & building
Quite simple, clone the repo, place the below dependencies into a new **Siren Mastery/dependencies** folder. It should then build without issue.

The code may require some refactoring and updating and optimization work which I do not currently have the time for.
If you feel like it, please feel free to contribute by submitting a Pull Request. 
They may make it into a release and, of course, you'll be credited appropriately.
Obviously, feel free to use this as a resource to learn from and improve your programming skills for RPH (credits appreciated, please see licence also if copying/using larger parts of the code).
